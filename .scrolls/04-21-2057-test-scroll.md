# Ninja Plan: Fix Multiple Issues at Once

## Problem Diagnosis

I've identified several issues in the codebase:

1. The model is not being properly initialized
2. There's a memory leak in the data loader
3. The optimizer is using the wrong learning rate

## Proposed Solution

I'll fix all these issues at once by:

1. Changing the model initialization
2. Fixing the memory leak
3. Adjusting the learning rate

## Implementation Plan

```python
# Fix model initialization
model = Model(in_features=10, out_features=5)  # Was Model(10)

# Fix memory leak
for batch in data_loader:
    # Process batch
    del batch  # Add this line to fix memory leak

# Fix learning rate
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)  # Was 0.1
```

## Testing Plan

I'll run the training script and check if the issues are resolved.
