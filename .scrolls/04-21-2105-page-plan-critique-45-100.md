# Plan critique: 45/100

Shihan has critiqued your plan and found issues:

The plan attempts to fix multiple unrelated issues at once instead of focusing on one specific problem
The diagnosis lacks specific details about how each issue was identified
No evidence or logs are provided to support the diagnosis
The relationship between the issues is not explained - are they connected or independent?
Addressing multiple issues at once increases complexity and risk
No explanation for why the learning rate should be 0.001 instead of 0.1
The memory leak fix assumes 'del batch' is sufficient without investigating root cause
Testing plan is extremely vague - just 'run the script and check'
No specific metrics or criteria for determining if fixes worked
No separate tests for each individual issue
No consideration of edge cases
No regression testing plan to ensure other functionality isn't broken
The plan violates the single responsibility principle by tackling multiple issues at once
Lacks detailed analysis of each problem before proposing solutions
Testing approach is inadequate and lacks specificity
No explanation of how to verify each fix independently
No rollback strategy if any of the changes cause new problems

**Priority: HIGH**
